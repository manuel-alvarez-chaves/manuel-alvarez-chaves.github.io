The [UNITE Toolbox](https://github.com/manuel-alvarez-chaves/unite_toolbox) is a Python library for incorporating Information Theory into data analysis and modeling workflows. The toolbox collects methods of non-parametric statistics to calculate quantities which are relevant in Information Theory, such as Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mutual Information.

Through this project I learned research software engineering in Python. The library is deployed in PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.
