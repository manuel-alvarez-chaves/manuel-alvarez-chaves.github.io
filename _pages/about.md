I'm a Doctoral Researcher at the University of Stuttgart under the supervision of [Dr. Anneli Guthke](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/people/Guthke-00002/). Our research group, [Statistical Model Data-Integration (SMDI)](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/research/junior-research-groups/statistical-model-data-integration/) is within the Cluster of Excellence of the Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science (SimTech). 

My research focuses in hybrid models for Earth Sciences and specifically, Hydrology. By hydrid models I mean any model which combines physics-based process description and data-driven components. I'm also interested in model evaluation, probabilistic modeling, information theory and a little bit of phylosophy of science.

In the past, I wrote my M. Sc. thesis in the [EnGeoModels](https://engeomodels.upc.edu/en) research group of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Barcelona under the supervision of Vicente Medina (and Marcel HÃ¼rlimann). The thesis for my License degree in Civil Engineering was written within the Center for [Research in Sustainable Development (CIEDES)](https://ciedes.ucr.ac.cr/) of the University of Costa Rica under the supervision of former director Rafael Oreamuno Vega.
